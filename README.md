# GREENWAY-INSIGHTS---FUEL-EFFICIENCY-PREDICTOR

üöó Project Overview
Greenway Insights is an intelligent fuel efficiency prediction solution for vehicles, developed as part of the IBM EdTech Youth Challenge. This project harnesses the power of machine learning to accurately estimate a car‚Äôs miles-per-gallon (MPG) by analyzing multiple accessible vehicle characteristics. It enables users, manufacturers, and policymakers to make informed decisions that benefit both the economy and the environment.

üéØ Project Goals
Accurate Forecasts: Predict a car‚Äôs MPG using technical parameters such as weight, horsepower, acceleration, etc.

Empower Users: Deliver actionable insights to help maximize fuel savings.

Sustainability Focus: Encourage eco-friendly vehicle design and policy-making by providing clear evidence-driven recommendations.

üìä Key Features
Effortless Prediction: Users input vehicle details; instant MPG predictions are delivered.

Visual Insights: Actual vs. predicted MPG displayed via intuitive graphs for easy comparison and understanding.

Fuel Efficiency Classification: Immediate notification of whether the entered vehicle is ‚Äúfuel efficient‚Äù or ‚Äúnot fuel efficient‚Äù (>30 MPG threshold).

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details
Data Preparation
Dataset: UCI Auto MPG Dataset

Features: cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, origin

Preprocessing: Column cleaning, normalization, categorical encoding, and missing value handling

Model Deployment
Algorithm: Linear Regression (with code support for Random Forest Regressor)

Evaluation: Measures used include Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R¬≤ Score for precision and reliability

Visualization: Interactive scatter plot illustrates model accuracy

üßëüíª Quick Start Guide
Requirements
Python 3.x

Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

How to Use
Place Auto_Data_Set_963_49.csv in your project directory.

Update the file path in the script as needed.

Run the Python script:

bash
python greenway_insights.py
Enter the required vehicle details when prompted.

View the predicted MPG and classification result; the actual vs. predicted MPG graph will be displayed.

‚úÖ User Experience Workflow
